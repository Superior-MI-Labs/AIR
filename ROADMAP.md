# AIR Public Roadmap

AIR is research software. This roadmap describes areas of investigation, not
promised release dates.

## Current public checkpoint: 0.10.0

The current release establishes:

- an internal architecture-adapter and prepared-semantic model boundary;
- Reference/CUDA execution independent of Qwen2 source tensor naming below preparation;
- Qwen2 as the sole qualified production model architecture;
- one production inference path;
- bounded scheduling/backpressure;
- reference and CUDA execution;
- exact sequence-state ownership;
- native generation;
- bounded semantic Decision;
- installable CMake package;
- browser command center;
- release qualification and evidence discipline.

## Near-term public research

### Long-context concurrent prefill

Release qualification showed strong short-request concurrency scaling but weak
long-context c7 throughput/TTFT behavior.

Post-release research is separating:

- scheduler prefill quantum;
- execution/microbatch shape;
- KV page geometry;
- kernel occupancy/bandwidth effects;
- fairness and TTFT coupling.

No source optimization is retained without correctness and machine evidence.

### Browser/setup experience

The public web application is being developed toward a local software-like
experience:

- system readiness;
- dependency guidance;
- model selection;
- launch/status;
- generation;
- Decision;
- runtime/diagnostics.

A future bootstrap helper must stay separate from inference and must not expose
generic shell execution.

### Wider model/hardware qualification

The current public support boundary is intentionally narrow. Broader
architecture/device support requires explicit qualification rather than
assuming all GGUF files behave equivalently.

## Deliberately deferred

- calibrated Decision confidence;
- automatic Decision scorer selection;
- abstention/multi-select thresholds;
- persistent CUDA cross-request state retention;
- fuzzy semantic execution-state reuse;
- generic response caching inside AIR.

Some of these responsibilities may belong outside AIR entirely.

## How to contribute

Useful contributions include:

- reproducible bug reports;
- portability fixes;
- characterization tests;
- independent benchmark reproduction;
- UI/diagnostic improvements;
- falsifiable performance hypotheses.
