# AIR Adaptive Execution Substrate R0 - Current

Updated: 2026-09-29
Status: WAVE 0 CURRENT / PROMPT 2 CURRENT

## Frozen baseline

AIR 0.10.0 is RELEASED / QUALIFIED.

Tag:
`v0.10.0`

Qualified source commit:
`3b728a1e45ae3c908aeb859b60cba3c2f5463506`

Release:
`AIR 0.10.0 — Modular Model Architecture Boundary`

AIR 0.10.0 remains the frozen evidence authority for that release.

## Active branch

`architecture/adaptive-execution-substrate-r0`

Created directly from the qualified 0.10.0 commit.

## Current mission

Establish the architecture and evidence program for AIR as a standalone
adaptive execution substrate where:

- computation is explicit data;
- hardware topology is explicit data;
- dynamic execution environment is explicit data;
- execution plans are derived data;
- performance observations are evidence;
- semantics remain authoritative and cannot be guessed.

## Current wave

Wave 0: freeze, assumption census, and observability contract.

No broad refactor is authorized yet.

## Work completed in Wave 0 initialization

Created and grounded against AIR 0.10.0 source:

- `BASELINE.md`;
- `ASSUMPTION-CENSUS.md`;
- `EVIDENCE-CENSUS.md`;
- `GUI-CENSUS.md`;
- `DATA-MODEL.md`;
- `GUI.md`;
- `QUESTION-BANK.md`;
- `AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`;
- `WAVE0.md`.

Important initial finding:

AIR already contains `HardwareTopology` v1. Do not create a parallel
HardwareGraph. Current topology mixes relatively stable physical facts with
dynamic available capacity and empirical link measurements, making
fact/state/measurement separation a primary Wave 0 question.

## AIR 0.11 release strategy

The active release strategy is:

`docs/adaptive-execution/RELEASE-0.11-STRATEGY.md`

Prompt 1 is:

`docs/adaptive-execution/PROMPT-01.md`

Testing/user-validation authority:

`docs/adaptive-execution/TESTING-STRATEGY.md`

## Prompt 1 qualified baseline

Prompt 1 is CLOSED / QUALIFIED.

Qualified source:
`15cc24f3946707dbe2ee9843d9e8379c77b08e1e`

WolfCat evidence:
`/home/emerson/Downloads/AIR-0.11-Prompt1-20260929-175415`

Both CPU-only and CUDA builds passed 12/12 CTests. Canonical machine discovery
correctly identified the i7-11800H, 31.08 GiB RAM, and RTX 3080 Laptop GPU
(`sm86`) while keeping dynamic availability separate from structural
fingerprinting.

## Prompt 2 current

Prompt 2 authority:

`docs/adaptive-execution/PROMPT-02.md`

Implemented in source for qualification:

- separate host topology discovery and environment observation;
- separate CUDA topology augmentation and environment augmentation;
- canonical `discover_machine_hardware()` composition;
- one shared topology/environment/discovery JSON serializer;
- CLI migrated to the canonical composed discovery and shared JSON schema;
- read-only `GET /machine`;
- read-only `GET /environment`;
- Prompt 2 qualifier that re-runs Prompt 1 nonregression and then tests
  CPU-only and CUDA server surfaces.

No planner/scheduler/inference policy change is intended.

## Immediate next action

Run:

```text
bash scripts/qualify-adaptive-prompt2.sh \
  ~/Models/AIR/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

Prompt 2 closes only after the full CPU-only + CUDA qualification and endpoint
identity checks pass on WolfCat-Studio.

## Current architectural hypothesis

The likely long-term lowering chain is:

```text
package/resource description
        ->
semantic computation
        ->
physical execution graph
        ->
kernel/device specialization
        ->
machine
```

This is a hypothesis, not yet a frozen IR.

## Second implementation

A multi-component image generation workflow is the intended second structural
discriminator.

Do not add a generalized semantic IR until the Qwen2 and second-implementation
requirements have been compared.

## Handoff rule

At the end of every substantial session:

- update this file with active wave and exact HEAD;
- record decisions in the relevant wave/design document;
- record failed experiments;
- leave one concrete next action;
- do not rely on chat context alone.
